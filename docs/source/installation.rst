Installation
=============


``astroqtpy`` is registered on ``pip``. To install ``astroqtpy`` with
``pip``, you can simply open a new terminal and execute the command:

.. code-block:: bash
	
	$ pip install astroqtpy


(Stolen from ``orbitize!``:)
We recommend installing and running ``astroqtpy`` in a ``conda`` virtual
environment. Install ``anaconda`` or ``miniconda`` 
`here <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_, then see 
`these instructions <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_
to learn more about ``conda`` virtual environments.
