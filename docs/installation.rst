Installation
=============


``astroqtpy`` pip installable. All you need to do to install ``astroqtpy`` and its dependencies
is open a new terminal and execute this command:

We recommend installing and running ``astroqtpy`` in a ``conda`` virtual environment. Install ``anaconda`` or 
``miniconda`` `here <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_, then see 
`these instructions <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_ to learn more 
about ``conda`` virtual environments (stolen from `orbitize! <https://orbitize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_).
